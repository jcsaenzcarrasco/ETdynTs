# ETdynTs
## Dynamic Trees through Euler tours under the functional programming setting.

Euler-tour trees answer  the query "are these two nodes connected?" for a forest of unrooted trees. Also permit to **_link_** two nodes provided the nodes belong to different components in a forest and **_cut_** an edge where the nodes involved are members of the same component within a forest.

We also present in this repository the work in progress for publication regarding dynamic trees through Euler-tours

We accompany every operations and some details throught the Haskell programming language
